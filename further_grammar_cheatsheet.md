This grammar cheatsheet is for further studies after colloquial korean. I am using TTMIK (Talk To Me In Korean) level 4 and above.

# introductory definitions

$V_b$ is the dictionary base, without the 다.

$V_{\cancel{요}}$ is the 아/어 form, without the 요.

Now we introduce $V_m$. We want to use a verb $V$ to modify a noun $N$. To achieve this, we introduce a 'modifying' form, $V_m$, as below:

> | Tense   | modifying form $(V_m)$ |
> | ------- | ---------------------- |
> | Past    | $V_m =  V_b$(으)ㄴ     |
> | Present | $V_m = V_b$는          |
> | Future  | $V_m = V_b$(으)ㄹ      |

# Main

### 〜通りに

To say that we're doing $A$ according to $B$, we say:

> $B_m$데로 $A$

e.g. 아버지께 배운데로 했습니다.  - I did just as you (Father) told me.

Note that 데로 seems like a cognate from japanese 通り. Indeed, the way they use it here is almost identical.

### TTMIK 4 - 1: "the more  ..., the more...", "in particular..", "as time goes by..."

For verbs $A,B$, we say "the more $A$, the more $B$" as follows:

> $A_b$(으)ㄹ 수록 $B$ 

For a noun $N$, we say:

> $N$일 수록 $B$

note that the conjugation of $A$ here is just like the one in 수 있/없다, and that 일 comes from 이다. 

examples:

맛있을 수록 잘 팔려요. The more delicious it is, the better it sells.

바쁠수록 간강이 중요해요. - The busier you are, the more important your health is.

To emphasize the $A$ part above, koreans like to use this grammar pattern:

> $A_b$(으)면 $A_b$(으)ㄹ 수록 $B$

**Note that there are also meanings of **

1. Even more so, especially when
2. Especially if
3. Particularly when

in this grammar pattern.

For example:

e.g. 학생일 수록 책을 많이 일어야 돼요. - You need to read a lot of books especially when you're a student.

##### As time goes by..

To say "it keeps getting $B$", or "as time goes by, $B$", we say:

> 갈 수록 $B$

Note that this is similar to the chinese 越来越... We use 가다 as the 来 here.

e.g. 갈수록 추워요. - It keeps getting colder.

### TTMIK 4 - 2: "It can't be that...", "There's no way"

For a verb $V$, To say it can't be that $V$, or there's no way that $V$ happens, we say:

> $V_b$(으)ㄹ 리가 없다

For a noun $N$, we use 이다 as the verb. So:

> $N$일 리가 없다

Note that 리 here is 理, which means logic. So we can literally translate it as "There's no logic if $V$ happens, or $N$ is the case."

Examples:

내일 눈이 올 리가 없다. - There's no way it's gna snow tomorrow..

정말요? 그럴 리가 없다. - Really? That can't be true! (Note: 그럴 comes from 그렇다)

### TTMIK 4 - 7: "To be okay, 괜찮다"

There are 4 uses of 괜찮다.

1. "I am okay", "I am alright", "Everything is fine"
2. "Don't worry", "No Worries"
3. "It's good", "It's cool", "It's recommendable" e.g. this movie is reall good
4. "No thanks, I'm good, " (polite refusal)

### TTMIK 4 - 10: "사이에(서)" - in between

Besides the physical / geographical meaning of 사이, we can use it to say "among" X. 

e.g. 친구들 사이에서 누구가 친절해요?

 ### TTMIK 4 - 11: Anybody, anything, Anywhere

아무 means "any". Note that the ending  (나/도) we use is different when the sentence is positive or negative.

| word (positive - 나) | word (negative - 도) | translation                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 아무나               | 아무도               | anybody, anyone                |
| 아무것나             | 아무것도             | anything, doesn't matter what  |
| 아무데나             | 아무데도             | anywhere                       |
| 아무 때나            | 아무 때도            | anytime                        |
| 아무렇게나           | N/A                  | in any way, however you'd like |
| ?                    | 아무한테도           | to nobody, no one              |

Note that 데 originally means "spot" or "place".

Note that negative doesn't NECESSARILY mean using 안 or ~지 않다. It could be something like 모르다, 없다.

Note that 도 is like も in japanese. 아무도 = 誰も

**examples**:

아무데도 안 갈 거야. - I'm not going anywhere.

아무것도 만지지 마세요. - Don't touch anything.

아무데나 좋아요. - Any place is good.

아무도 없어요? - Nobody's here?

아무도 올 수 없어요. - 誰も来られない

아무한테도 주시 말고 혼자 먹어요. - Don't share this with anyone, eat it alone.

Look at the difference below:

아무거나 먹으면 안 돼요 - You shouldn't eat just anything.

아무것도 먹으면 안 돼요. - You shouldn't eat anything at all

For a noun $N$, to say not any $N$, we say:

> 아무 $N$도 (negative verb)

e.g.

아무 맛도 없어요. - It is tasteless (it doesn't have ANY taste)

아 말도 안 했죠? - You didn't tell them anything right?

### TTMIK 4 - 18: Superlative (제일, 가장)

To say the superlative form of an adjective $A$, we say:

> 제일/가장 $A$

Note that 제일 is sino-korean, and it is written in 한자 as 第一. 가장 is native korean.

Note that 제일 is used more commonly in spoken Korean than 가장.

e.g.

이게 제일 좋아요.

제일 가까운 역이 어디에요.?

제일 먼저 온 사람이 누구예요?

### TTMIK 4 - 19: Less, not completely (덜)

Recall how we learned 더 - which means "more". 덜 means less. It is used in the same way. For an Adjective $A$, we form:

> 덜 $A$

e.g

어제보다 덜 추워요. - It's less cold than yesterday.

덜 비싼 것 없어요? - Don't you have a less expensive one?

### TTMIK 4 - 24: Much more, much less 훨씬

훨씬 means much (more) or far (more). To say much more $A$ for an adjective $A$,

> 훨씬 (더) $A$

Note that (더) can be dropped for the above.

To say much less, we say (as predicted):

> 훨씬 덜 $A$

However, 덜 **cannot be dropped** from the above.

일본어보다 한국어가 훨씬 더 쉬워요. - Korean is **much easier** than Japanese.
